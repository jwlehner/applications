Please explain in 250 or fewer words why you think a fellowship in İstanbul at
the RCAC, in particular, with its connection to Koç University, is essential to
your research.

I am convinced that a Post-Doc Fellowship at RCAC will have a determinant
impact not only on my research project but more generally for my whole career.
I outline here four main reasons:

  - I am genuiningly seeking to enhance international collaboration. I
consider archeology as a community endeavor, and I am persuaded that my research
will intensely profit of this intellectual setting, uniquely concentrating so many talents,
with RCAC fellows and members at the Koç University.

  -  I am looking to be based in Istanbul to collaborate with different
survey projects in Turkey (to share and compare methods and data). Specifically, I welcome the opportunity to to collaborate with members of Koç University, including Chris Roosevelt and Christina Luke, with whom I share similar approaches and regional expertise.

  -  I require specific libraries in Istanbul (particularly RCAC, DAI, and BOA)
to complete my database and integrate previous environmental and
archaeological work.

  -  During my doctoral research, I did not have the occasion to work with
facilities like the KUYTAM laboratory at Koç University. I am inclined to develop skills during a stay at RCAC and to do compositional and
petrographic analysess on ceramic materials from the Panormos Project and from my dissertation research. I can provide material from these projects and include the results in my research. This program of research would also provide new lines of collaboration with materials science experts at Koç.  I am sure that this
would be determinant for my carrier to strength my knowledge in this domain,
especially for a future Marie Curie Grant application.
