Please explain in 250 or fewer words why you think a fellowship in İstanbul at
the RCAC, in particular, with its connection to Koç University, is essential to
your research.

I am convinced that a Post-Doc Fellowship at RCAC will have a determinant
impact not only on my research project but more generally for my whole career,
for four main reasons:

First, I am genuinely looking for being a member of international teams. I
consider archeology as a community endeavor and I am persuaded that my research
will intensely profit of this setting, uniquely concentrating so many talents,
with RCAC fellows and members at the Koç University.

Second, I am looking to be based in Istanbul to collaborate with different
survey projects in Turkey (on the methodology and on the sharing of data) but I
plan also to collaborate with Bülent Arıkan (Dept. Ecology and Evolution,
Eurasia Institute of Earth Sciences, İTÜ), with whom I share similar approaches.

Third, I require specific libraries in Istanbul (particularly RCAC, DAI and BOA)
to   complete my database and integrate previous environmental and
archaeological work

Forth, during my doctoral research, I had not the occasion to work with
laboratory facilities like the KUYTAM laboratories at Koç University. I am
really inclined to develop skills during a stay at RCAC and to do INAA and
petrographic analysis on ceramic sherds. I could provide material from the
Panormos Project and include the results in my research.  I am sure that this
would be determinant for my carrier to strength my knowledge in this domain,
especially for a future Marie Curie Grant application.
