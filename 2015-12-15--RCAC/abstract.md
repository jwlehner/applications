# The Visualization of Diachronic Human-environment Interactions: A Model for the Milesian Peninsula

This project aims to characterize the nature and intensity of the
human-environment interactions (including exchange networks, settlement patterns,
hinterland occupation, and commodity flows) on the Milesian Peninsula
(southwestern Turkey, province of Aydın) from the prehistoric to the ottoman era
(ca. 5th millennium B.C./2nd millennium A.D.). This project is divided into two
interdependent parts.

First, as a senior member of the *Panormos Survey Project*, I will analyze freshly collected data from this micro-region using novel visualization methods (point patterns, surface modeling)
that more accurately and precisely reflect the underlying
processes that drive cultural change. These analyses will be used to explain the dramatic changes we observe on the Milesian Peninsula,specifically the rise of social complexity and large-scale shifting in human-environment interactions.

Second, using the survey data, this project will examine uncertainty and inaccuracy in time and space (intrinsic to the nature of
data) as well as in the collection of data (i.e. 'human error'). These issues have been
underestimated in archaeological applications. To address this problem, I will
adapt statistical methods (Monte Carlo and aoristic analysis) to the archaeological
records. This part of the project aims to expand the capacity of formulating independently verifiable
human-environment generalizations and will have a broader impact on field methods in archaeology.

Additionally, an important goal of this project is to fascilitate and stengthen ongoing
relations between survey projects. The computational implementation of this project will use the
open source programming language R and thus make my research more transparent,
reusable, adaptable, and modifiable by other survey projects in Anatolia.
